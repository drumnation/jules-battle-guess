# Unit Test Debugging Guide

This task list is generated to help debug failing unit tests in the project. Follow these steps to systematically fix the failing tests:

## Instructions

1. **Review the Test Results Below**
   - Check the "Failing Tests" section for tests that need attention
   - Note the "Passing Tests" section for reference and regression testing
   - Each test entry includes a command to run that specific test

2. **For Each Failing Test:**
   - Run the test in isolation using the provided command
   - Review the test output and error messages
   - Check the test file and the code being tested
   - Make necessary fixes in either the test or the implementation
   - Run the test again to verify the fix
   - Update this task list when the test passes

3. **After Fixing Tests:**
   - Run all tests again to check for regressions
   - Update this task list with the final results
   - Document any significant findings or patterns
