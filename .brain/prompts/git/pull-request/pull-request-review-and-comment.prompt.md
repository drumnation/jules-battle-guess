***ACTION REQUIRED:** Read the PR data package file, retrieve necessary context (commit metadata, guidelines, diff), analyze the changes against the guidelines, and generate detailed code review comments and a summary report in Markdown format. Output only the generated Markdown review. Do not describe this prompt; execute the steps within it.

# Prompt for AI: Review Pull Request from Data Package

You are an AI-powered code reviewer. You will receive the path to a JSON file containing packaged data about a Pull Request (PR). Your task is to read this package, retrieve related information (commit details, guidelines, diff), perform a thorough code review based on the guidelines, generate specific comments, and provide a comprehensive summary.

**Input:**

1.  **PR Data File Path:** [Provide the path to the JSON data package file generated by `pull-request-define-and-package.prompt.md`, e.g., `.brain/git/pr-packages/main-feat-xyz-pr-data.json`]

**Instructions:**

1.  **Read PR Data Package:**
    * Read and parse the JSON file at the `[PR Data File Path]`. Extract fields like `prTitle`, `prDescription`, `prBranch`, `targetBranch`, `commitHashes`, `baseCommitHash`, `codeStandardsRef`. Handle file read/parse errors (STOP if invalid).
    * Log the PR Title being reviewed.

2.  **Retrieve Code Standards:**
    * If `codeStandardsRef` exists in the JSON data, read the content of the referenced guideline file. This is the **Code Review Guidelines** document. Handle errors if the file is missing. If no reference provided, proceed using general best practices but note this limitation.

3.  **Generate/Retrieve PR Diff:**
    * **Goal:** Obtain the full diff representing the changes in the PR.
    * **Method:** Using the `baseCommitHash` (or determining the merge base between `targetBranch` and `prBranch` if base is null/missing) and the last commit hash in `commitHashes` (or the `prBranch` name itself), construct and execute the appropriate `git diff` command (e.g., `git diff [base or merge-base]..[prBranch]` or `git diff [base]..[last_hash]`). Capture the full diff output. Handle errors during diff generation (STOP if fails). This is the **PR Diff**.

4.  **Retrieve Commit Metadata (Context):**
    * For each hash in the `commitHashes` list extracted from the JSON package:
        * Construct path: `.brain/git/commits/[xx]/[hash].json`.
        * Read and parse JSON metadata (`messageSubject`, `messageBody`, etc.) to understand individual commit intent.
    * Handle missing/invalid metadata files gracefully.

5.  **Perform Code Review:**
    * **Understand Context:** Use the extracted `prTitle`, `prDescription`, and retrieved commit metadata.
    * **Analyze Diff:** Examine the generated `PR Diff` content.
    * **Apply Standards:** Compare changes against the retrieved `Code Review Guidelines`.
    * **Identify Issues:** Look for violations/areas for improvement (Correctness, Security, Performance, Readability, Best Practices, Testing, etc.) based *specifically* on the guidelines and the code changes.

6.  **Generate Comments:**
    * For each significant issue/suggestion identified:
        * Generate a clear, concise, constructive comment referencing the specific file/line in the diff.
        * Explain the reasoning, referencing the Guideline rule number/section if possible.
        * Offer specific suggestions/snippets.
        * Assign a category (e.g., `Guideline Violation`, `Suggestion`, `Security`).

7.  **Structure Output:**
    * Organize feedback by file path.
    * Include an overall assessment, summary (Strengths, Areas for Improvement), Questions, and Verdict.
    * Format the entire output as a single Markdown document.

**Output:**

* Respond ONLY with a single Markdown document containing the comprehensive code review. Do not include any other introductory or concluding text. Use the structure from the previous version's example output.

**Crucial Instructions for AI:**
* **ACTION REQUIRED:** Execute NOW.
* **Input Source:** Primary input is the `PR Data File Path`.
* **Data Retrieval:** MUST read the package file, guidelines file (if referenced), commit metadata files, and generate the PR diff using info from the package file.
* **Guideline Adherence:** Review MUST be based on the retrieved guidelines applied to the generated diff.
* **Output Format:** Strictly output ONLY the Markdown review report.
* **Error Handling:** Handle file reading errors, diff generation errors, missing guidelines gracefully. Stop on critical failures.
