‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó IMMEDIATE AUTO-TRIGGER

A multi-step workflow that runs type checking, linting, and formatting in sequence to validate and improve code quality.

## Workflow Overview:
1. Run TypeScript type checking to identify type errors
2. Run ESLint to identify and fix linting issues
3. Run Prettier to format code consistently
4. Provide a comprehensive quality report

## Execution Steps:
1. **Type Checking**
   - Run the `../typecheck-code.prompt.md` to identify type errors
   - If critical errors exist, flag them for immediate attention
   - Continue to the next step even if errors are found (to provide complete report)

2. **Linting**  
   - Run the `../lint-code.prompt.md` to identify and fix linting issues
   - Apply automatic fixes where safe
   - Report on remaining issues that need manual attention

3. **Formatting**
   - Run the `../format-code.prompt.md` to standardize code style
   - Apply formatting changes immediately
   - Report on which files were affected

4. **Results Summary**
   - Provide an overall quality assessment
   - List critical issues that need attention
   - Suggest next steps based on findings
