TASK: Transform Text to Match Writing Style (Optimized for Text-to-Speech - REVISED 2)

GOAL: Rewrite the provided input text to match the writing style identified in the previous analysis, with a strong emphasis on clarity, natural flow, and accurate spoken delivery by text-to-speech (TTS) tools, specifically addressing limitations with parentheses and numerals.

TARGET STYLE:

(This section summarizes your key stylistic features, refined for TTS. Adjust as needed.)

* **Sentence Structure and Complexity:**
  * Favor a mix of simple and compound sentences. Actively minimize the use of overly long or complex sentences with multiple embedded clauses.
  * Prioritize clear, direct sentence structures with a consistent subject-verb-object order.
  * Vary sentence length for rhythm, but avoid abrupt or extreme shifts. Aim for a more consistent, moderate pace.
* **Vocabulary and Word Choice:**
  * Use precise and accurate language, but avoid overly technical jargon that might sound unnatural or require TTS to pause awkwardly.
  * Maintain a conversational tone with informal language, but carefully select colloquialisms or slang to ensure they are universally understood and sound natural when spoken.
  * Use strong and vivid descriptive words to add emphasis and engagement, but avoid overly ornate or flowery language that can sound artificial in TTS.
* **Technical Terminology:**
  * Use technical terms only when they are essential for accuracy.
  * When using technical terms, provide brief, spoken-style explanations or definitions using appositives or relative clauses instead of parentheses (e.g., "OCR, which stands for Optical Character Recognition...").
* **Informal Language and Contractions:**
  * Use contractions frequently (e.g., "it's," "don't," "can't") as they generally enhance the naturalness and flow of spoken language.
  * Use colloquialisms sparingly and with careful consideration for clarity and widespread understanding. Avoid highly regional or niche slang.
* **Personal Voice and Engagement:**
  * Include personal anecdotes, experiences, and opinions where relevant, as this contributes to the conversational and engaging nature of the text.
  * Maintain a first-person perspective (using "I," "my," "we") to create a sense of direct communication and personal involvement.
* **Direct Address and Reader Connection:**
  * Use "you" and "we" to address the reader directly, as this fosters a more engaging and spoken feel, making the listener feel like they are part of a conversation.
* **Enthusiasm and Emphasis:**
  * Use strong and varied adjectives and adverbs to convey excitement, interest, and emphasis, but avoid excessive exclamation, overly dramatic phrasing, or language that might sound unnatural or forced when spoken.
* **Lists and Bullet Points (Structure for TTS):**
  * Organize information with lists and bullet points, but use clear introductory phrases before each list and structure the lists in a way that is easy for TTS to read and for a listener to follow (e.g., avoid deeply nested lists or complex formatting within list items).
  * Avoid complex formatting within list items.
* **Parentheticals and Dashes (Clarity and Flow):**
  * **Eliminate the use of parentheses and dashes entirely, as they can disrupt the flow and pacing of spoken language and are ignored by Speechify.**
  * Rephrase any parenthetical information or asides as separate, grammatically complete sentences, appositives, relative clauses, or other sentence structures that integrate the information smoothly.
* **Transitions and Connectors (Pacing and Coherence):**
  * Use explicit transition words and phrases to guide the listener clearly through the text (e.g., "first," "next," "then," "however," "in addition," "to begin," "furthermore," "to summarize").
  * Pay careful attention to the rhythm and pacing of transitions when spoken, ensuring they create smooth and natural connections between ideas.
* **Emphasis and Highlighting (Phrasing and Repetition):**
  * Avoid relying heavily on formatting elements like bolding and italics for emphasis, as TTS interpretation can vary across different tools and platforms.
  * Instead, use strategic phrasing, careful word choice, and repetition to create emphasis and highlight key points (e.g., "it is *absolutely essential* to remember that...", "the *most critical* point is...", "and I want to emphasize that...").
* **Numerals:**
  * **Spell out numerals (numbers) when they are crucial for understanding** (e.g., "the first step," "three reasons," "twenty-four hours").
  * For large numbers or those used in technical contexts, consider whether spelling them out enhances or hinders clarity. Use your judgment.

TRANSFORMATION RULES (Prioritized for TTS):

1. **Sentence Structure and Complexity (Weight: 10 - Paramount for Flow):**
   * Vary sentence length and structure to maintain listener interest, but prioritize a balance of simple and compound sentences.
   * Actively reduce or eliminate the use of long, complex sentences with multiple embedded clauses or convoluted syntax.
   * Break down any existing complex sentences into shorter, clearer units with a consistent subject-verb-object order.
   * Carefully adjust clause placement to optimize the spoken rhythm and flow, avoiding sentences where the main clause is delayed or obscured.
2. **Vocabulary and Word Choice (Weight: 15 - Balancing Precision and Naturalness):**
   * Replace generic words with more precise, vivid, and engaging alternatives, but always choose words that sound natural and conversational when spoken.
   * Incorporate informal language where appropriate to maintain a conversational tone, but avoid slang, overly technical terms, or complex phrasing that might confuse or sound unnatural to a listener.
   * Use strong adjectives and adverbs to express enthusiasm and add emphasis, but avoid hyperbole, exaggeration, or overly dramatic language that could sound forced or insincere in TTS.
3. **Transitions and Connectors (Weight: 10 - Crucial for Listener Comprehension):**
   * Add or adjust transition words and phrases to explicitly and clearly guide the listener through the text, ensuring a smooth and logical progression of ideas.
   * Use clear and explicit transitions (e.g., "to begin," "furthermore," "to summarize," "in conclusion") to signal shifts in topic, emphasis, or argumentation.
   * Pay close attention to the pacing and rhythm of transitions when spoken, ensuring they sound natural and don't create awkward pauses or interruptions.
4. **Technical Terminology (Weight: 10 - Prioritizing Clarity):**
   * Where appropriate for the context and target audience, use precise technical terms, but always provide brief, spoken-style explanations or definitions using appositives or relative clauses instead of parentheses.
   * Prioritize clarity and ease of comprehension over strict technical accuracy if it significantly improves the listener's ability to follow the information.
5. **Personal Voice and Engagement (Weight: 10 - Connecting with the Listener):**
   * Continue to incorporate personal anecdotes, experiences, and opinions where relevant, as this adds to the conversational and engaging nature of the text and helps establish a connection with the listener.
   * Maintain a first-person perspective (using "I," "my," "we") to create a sense of direct communication and personal involvement.
6. **Direct Address and Reader Connection (Weight: 5 - Fostering Engagement):**
   * Incorporate "you" and "we" to address the reader directly, as this creates a more engaging and spoken feel, making the listener feel like they are part of a conversation.
7. **Enthusiasm and Emphasis (Weight: 10 - Conveying Tone):**
   * Use strong and varied adjectives and adverbs to convey excitement, interest, and emphasis, but avoid excessive exclamation, overly dramatic phrasing, or language that might sound unnatural or forced when spoken.
8. **Lists and Bullet Points (Weight: 10 - Structuring Information for TTS):**
   * Organize information into lists or bullet points, but use clear introductory phrases before each list and structure the lists in a way that is easy for TTS to read and for a listener to follow (e.g., avoid deeply nested lists or complex formatting within list items).
9. **Informal Language and Contractions (Weight: 5 - Enhancing Naturalness):**
   * Use contractions frequently (e.g., "it's," "don't," "can't") as they generally sound natural and enhance the flow of spoken language.
   * Use colloquialisms sparingly and choose ones that are widely understood and sound natural when spoken, avoiding highly regional or niche slang.
10. **Parentheticals and Dashes (Weight: 5 - Eliminating Disruption):**
    * **Eliminate the use of parentheses and dashes entirely.**
    * Rephrase any parenthetical information or asides as separate, grammatically complete sentences, appositives, relative clauses, or other sentence structures that integrate the information smoothly.
11. **Emphasis and Highlighting (Weight: 5 - Using Phrasing and Repetition):**
    * Avoid relying heavily on formatting elements like bolding and italics for emphasis, as TTS interpretation can vary across different tools and platforms.
    * Instead, use strategic phrasing, careful word choice, and repetition to create emphasis and highlight key points (e.g., "it is *absolutely essential* to remember that...", "the *most critical* point is...", "and I want to emphasize that...").
12. **Numerals (Weight: 5 - Ensuring Accurate Reading):**
    * **Spell out numerals (numbers) when they are crucial for understanding** (e.g., "the first step," "three reasons," "twenty-four hours," "the year two thousand twenty-five").
    * For large numbers or those used in technical contexts, consider whether spelling them out enhances or hinders clarity. If spelling them out makes the text cumbersome or less clear, use numerals.

CONSTRAINTS:

* Maintain the core meaning and intent of the original text, ensuring accuracy and avoiding any unintended alterations in meaning.
* Preserve professional and contextual appropriateness, ensuring the transformed text is suitable for the intended audience and purpose when delivered orally.
