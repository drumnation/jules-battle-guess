* **Vocabulary:** Blend technical terms (where appropriate), informal language, and strong descriptive words.
* **Technical Jargon:** Use precise technical terms for a tech-savvy audience.
* **Informal Language:** Use contractions, colloquialisms (judiciously), and direct address ("you," "we") for a conversational tone.
* **Personal Voice:** Include personal anecdotes and opinions using "I," "my," "we."
* **Direct Address:** Speak to the reader using "you" and "we."
* **Enthusiasm:** Use strong adjectives and adverbs to convey excitement.
* **Lists/Bullet Points:** Organize information with lists and bullet points.
* **Parentheticals/Dashes:** Use parentheses for brief asides, dashes for stronger interruptions.
* **Transitions:** Use explicit and implicit transitions to connect ideas.
* **Emphasis:** Use bolding and italics for key elements.
