## AI-Brain-Garden Project Status & Feature Concept Review

**Objective:**  Provide a comprehensive project status update and evaluate potential new features for immediate development.

**Context:** You are stepping back into the AI-Brain-Garden project after a brief absence. The project's directory structure, overview, and task list are provided below, along with a catalog of previously developed features and a set of new feature concepts.

## Pre-flight:

1.  **Create status file:** 
    * Scan `@.brain/.status/` for the highest numbered plan
    * Filename format: `{incremented-number}-status-update.md`
    * Example: `05-status-update.md`

**Instructions:**

1.  **Project Status Summary:**
    *   Analyze the provided documents (`.brain/directory-structure.md`, `.brain/project-overview.md`, `.brain/project-plan.md`, and `.brain/group-meeting-notes.md`) to generate a concise summary of the project's current state.
    *   Specifically, address the following:
        *   What is the core problem this project is solving?
        *   What are the key features that have already been implemented (focus on the "Template System Enhancement")?
        *   What is the next major task or milestone ("Variable System Implementation"), and what are its subtasks?
        *   What are the latest technical insights or architectural decisions made?
        *   What are the immediate next steps outlined in the project status update log?
        *   Look at .brain/1-agent-smith/b-features/* and catalog progress on features.

2.  **Feature Concept Review:**
    *   Read all markdown files located in the `.brain/.concepts/` directory.
    *   For each concept:
        *   Briefly describe the proposed feature.
        *   Assess its potential value and alignment with the overall project goals (refer to `project-overview.md`).
        *   Recommend whether the concept should be:
            *   **Prioritized for immediate planning and development:** If it's a high-value addition that aligns with current priorities.
            *   **Scheduled for later consideration:** If it's valuable but can wait, or if it depends on other features not yet implemented.
            *   **Rejected:** If it's not aligned with the project goals, duplicates existing functionality, or is deemed infeasible.
        *   Consider the current project timeline and the "Variable System Implementation" task. Would adding any of these new features disrupt the immediate roadmap? If so, is the disruption justified by the feature's potential value?

**Deliverables:**

1.  **Project Status Report:** A well-structured report summarizing the current state of the project, addressing the points mentioned above.
2.  **Feature Concept Evaluation:** A table or list summarizing each concept, its description, value assessment, and your recommendation (Prioritize, Schedule, or Reject). Include a brief justification for each recommendation.

**Relevant Documents:**

*   `directory-structure.md`
*   `project-overview.md`
*   `project-plan.md`
*   `project-status-update-log.md`
*   Files within `.brain/.concepts/`
*   Files within `.brain/1-agent-smith/b-features/*`

**Note:**

*   Use clear and concise language.
*   Prioritize actionable insights that will help in making informed decisions about the project's next steps.
*   Think critically about the value and feasibility of each feature concept in the context of the overall project goals and current timeline.
