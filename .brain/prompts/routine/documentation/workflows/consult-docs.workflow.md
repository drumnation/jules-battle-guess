# Workflow: Consult Project Documentation Before Acting

## Purpose
Ensure the agent consults existing project documentation before beginning feature planning, debugging, architecture decisions, or shared component creation ‚Äî to reduce duplication, align with past decisions, and avoid introducing regressions.

---

## Step 1: Determine Scope

1. Identify the current objective:
   - Feature task planning
   - Error or bug investigation
   - Component refactor or design
   - Architecture or tooling decision

2. Extract any known identifiers:
   - Affected file paths
   - Package/app name
   - Feature name (if known)
   - Keywords from errors or PR titles

---

## Step 2: Prompt for Documentation Use

üì• **Run Prompt**: `@..brain/prompts/routine/use-project-docs.prompt.md`

**Input:**
- Purpose or context for this workflow (e.g., "Debugging form submission error in `apps/web/login.tsx`")
- Extracted identifiers from Step 1

---

## Step 3: Load Relevant Files

The agent should attempt to **read** and extract insight from relevant docs:
- `docs/features/[feature-name]/`
- `docs/concepts/`
- `docs/architecture/adr/`
- `docs/packages/[workspace]/`
- Root `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `PROJECT_GUIDELINES.md`

‚úÖ If files are missing, the agent should:
- Acknowledge gaps
- Suggest a stub be created (and potentially scaffold it if a ruleset allows)

---

## Step 4: Integrate Knowledge

The agent must **apply** relevant insights:
- Reference prior decisions in plan or strategy
- Align naming, architecture, or file placement
- Avoid duplicating existing helpers or components

‚úÖ Final output should include:
- ‚úÖ ‚ÄúDocs Consulted‚Äù section with paths
- ‚úÖ ‚ÄúKey Insights‚Äù summarized briefly
