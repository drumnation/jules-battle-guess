**ACTION REQUIRED:** Execute the following instruction generation task immediately. Use the provided Analysis Report to generate specific, actionable editing instructions suitable for the Cursor agent to automatically refine the original rules file. Output ONLY the Markdown instructions. Do not describe this prompt; execute the steps within it.

# Prompt for AI: Generate Rules File Refinement Instructions for Cursor

**Objective:** Generate specific editing instructions, based on a provided analysis report, that the Cursor agent can use to directly modify and improve the original rules file that was analyzed.

**Input:**

1.  **Rules File Analysis Report:** [The FULL Markdown content of the report generated by `analyze-prompt-quality.prompt.md` is expected immediately following this prompt text.]

**Instructions:**

1.  **Process Analysis Report:** Carefully read the input `Rules File Analysis Report`, focusing on the "Summary of Weaknesses & Improvement Areas" and the detailed assessments in previous sections.
2.  **Translate Findings into Edits:** For each identified weakness or area needing improvement, formulate a concise, specific instruction telling the Cursor agent *exactly* what change to make to the original rules file content (which is assumed to be available/attached in the Cursor context where these instructions will be used).
    * **Be Specific:** Refer to specific sections (e.g., "In `corePrinciples` item X", "In `applicationProcess.steps[Y].agentActions[Z]`"), rules, or lines if possible.
    * **Be Actionable:** Use imperative verbs (e.g., "Rewrite...", "Add example...", "Define term...", "Remove redundant rule...", "Add missing section `commonPitfalls`...").
    * **Provide Content:** Where appropriate, provide the specific text or code examples that should be added or used for replacement.
3.  **Structure Instructions:** Format the output as a Markdown list of instructions suitable for the Cursor agent's editing capabilities. Include the quality scores from the report for context.

**Output Format:**

Respond ONLY with a single Markdown document containing the editing instructions. Do not include introductory or concluding text.

```markdown
## Cursor Instructions for Rules File Improvement

**Based on Analysis Report Scores:**
* Clarity: [Score]/5
* Completeness: [Score]/5
* Implementation: [Score]/5
* Example Quality: [Score]/5

**Editing Instructions (Apply to the attached/original rules file):**

* **Instruction 1:** [Specific edit instruction derived from report. Example: In section `corePrinciples` for principle 'Clarity', rewrite the description to define 'unambiguous interpretation' more clearly.]
* **Instruction 2:** [Specific edit instruction. Example: Add a new `commonPitfalls` entry addressing 'Ignoring Edge Cases' with the following content: `{ name: 'Ignoring Edge Cases', description: '...', solution: '...', preventativeMeasures: [...] }`.]
* **Instruction 3:** [Specific edit instruction. Example: Add a concrete code example to `examples.useCases[1]` demonstrating scenario Y.]
* **Instruction N:** [Continue for all major improvement points identified in the report.]

**(Ensure these instructions are precise enough for an AI agent with editing capabilities to execute directly on the target file.)**
```

**Crucial Instructions for AI:**
* **ACTION REQUIRED:** Execute NOW.
* **Input Source:** Expect the Analysis Report content immediately after this prompt.
* **Focus:** Translate the *findings* in the report into *actions* for an editing agent.
* **Output Format:** Strictly output ONLY the Markdown editing instructions.
