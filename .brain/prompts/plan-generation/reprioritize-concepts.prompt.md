**Prompt:**

> **Objective:** To prioritize and sequence the assimilation of conceptual documents into a comprehensive project plan.
> 
> **Context:** We have a collection of conceptual documents stored within the `@.brain/.concepts` folder. These documents represent potential features, ideas, and components that might be integrated into the overall project. We also have a master project task list detailed in `@.brain/project-plan.md`. This list outlines the currently defined tasks, dependencies, and timelines for the project.
> 
> **Task:**
> 
> 1. **Comprehensive Analysis:** Thoroughly review and analyze each individual document contained within the `@.concepts` folder.  Understand the core idea, potential value proposition, and estimated complexity of each concept.
> 
> 2. **Comparative Evaluation:** Compare the extracted insights from each concept document against the existing tasks and objectives defined in `@project-plan.md`. Identify potential overlaps, dependencies, synergies, and conflicts between the proposed concepts and the current project plan. This analysis should consider factors such as:
>     * **Strategic Alignment:** Does the concept align with the overall project goals and objectives?
>     * **Feasibility:** Is the concept technically feasible within the project's constraints (e.g., technology, resources, timeline)?
>     * **Impact:** What is the potential positive impact of incorporating this concept (e.g., value to the user, increased efficiency)?
>     * **Dependencies:** Would this concept depend on other tasks being completed first, or would it create new dependencies for existing tasks?
>     * **Resource Allocation:** What resources (e.g., time, personnel, budget) would be required to implement this concept?
> 
> 3. **Prioritized Sequencing:** Based on the comparative evaluation, reorder the concept documents into a prioritized sequence for assimilation into the project plan. This sequence should reflect the logical order in which these concepts should be considered, evaluated, and potentially integrated. Begin the numbering at **00** and increment sequentially. The prioritization should be based on factors like the urgency, the impact of the concepts, and how they depend on tasks in the main project.
> 
> 4. **Rationale Documentation:** For each concept, provide a concise rationale justifying its assigned position in the sequence. This rationale should clearly articulate the reasons for its priority level, referencing the factors outlined in the comparative evaluation (e.g., "Concept X is prioritized high due to its high strategic alignment and potential impact. It is sequenced before Concept Y because it establishes foundational elements necessary for Y's implementation.").
>
> **Output:** A revised, ordered list of concept documents (from the `@.concepts` folder), renumbered starting from 00, accompanied by a clear rationale for each concept's placement in the sequence. This output will serve as a roadmap for systematically incorporating valuable concepts into the full project plan.
>
> **Goal:** The ultimate goal is to ensure a structured and strategic approach to incorporating new concepts into the project, maximizing their potential value while minimizing disruptions to the existing plan.
