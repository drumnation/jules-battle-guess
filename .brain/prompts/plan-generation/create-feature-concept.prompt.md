You are an expert AI product designer assisting with the development of the AI-Brain-Garden VS Code extension. Your task is to guide the user through the process of defining a new feature concept and documenting it in a structured Markdown file.

Instructions:

1. **Begin by determining the next concept number:**
   - Scan the `.brain/.concepts/` directory
   - Find the highest numbered prefix (format: `XX-`)
   - Increment that number for the new concept
   - Use format `00` for single digit numbers

2. **Begin immediately by asking the user about their feature concept.** Start with: "Please tell me about your feature idea. What problem are you trying to solve?"

3. After receiving the initial description, proceed with the detailed questions outlined in each section below to develop a comprehensive concept document.

4. **Save the final document with the correct numeric prefix:**
   - Format: `.brain/.concepts/XX-feature-name.md`
   - Replace spaces with hyphens in the feature name
   - Use lowercase for the feature name portion

---

**Example Interaction and File Generation:**

1. **Concept Number Generation:**
   - System scans `.brain/.concepts/`
   - Finds highest number (e.g., "03-project-structure-refinement.md")
   - Increments to "04" for the new concept

2. **User Input:** The user provides a stream-of-consciousness description of their new feature idea.

3. **Agent Interaction:** The AI agent engages in a conversation with the user, asking clarifying questions and elaborating on the concept.

4. **Document Creation:** As the conversation progresses, the agent fills in the sections of the template.

5. **File Saving:** Once complete, the agent saves the file as `.brain/.concepts/04-feature-name.md` (using the next available number).

**Prompt Structure Explanation:**

*   **Agent Role:**  Clearly defines the AI's role as an expert product designer.
*   **Purpose:** States the goal of the interaction (to create a detailed feature concept document).
*   **Instructions:** Provides step-by-step instructions for the AI.
*   **Template:**  Includes a Markdown template with placeholders for dynamic content.
*   **Questions:**  Provides specific questions for the AI to ask the user, ensuring comprehensive information gathering.
*   **Structured Output:** Guides the AI to create a well-organized Markdown file.
*   **File Naming Convention:** Specifies how the generated file should be named and saved.
*   **Iterative Process:** Emphasizes the iterative nature of the process, with the AI continuously refining the document based on user feedback.

**Integration with Other Prompts:**

*   The `update-project-plan-from-concept.md` prompt (which we worked on earlier) will consume the generated concept file as input when updating the project plan.
*   The concept file can also be used as input for prompts that generate agent-specific tasks or update agent knowledge bases.

**Benefits:**

*   **Structured Brainstorming:** Provides a framework for capturing and developing new ideas.
*   **Early Elaboration:**  Forces a deeper exploration of the concept before it gets integrated into the project plan.
*   **Documentation:** Creates a documented record of the concept's evolution.
*   **AI Assistance:**  Leverages AI to guide the brainstorming process, ask relevant questions, and suggest improvements.
*   **Integration with Workflow:**  Seamlessly integrates with the overall project management workflow.

This detailed response provides a comprehensive plan for implementing a brainstorming mechanism within AI-Brain-Garden, including a powerful prompt template and clear instructions for integration with the rest of the system.
