# Prompt for AI: Generate Rules File Refinement Instructions for Cursor

**Objective:** Generate specific editing instructions, based on a provided analysis report, that the Cursor agent can use to directly modify and improve the original rules file that was analyzed.

**Input:**

1.  **Rules File Analysis Report:** [The FULL Markdown content of the report generated by `analyze-rule-clarity.prompt.md` (or similar analysis prompt) is expected immediately following this prompt text.]

**Instructions:**

1.  **Process Analysis Report:** Carefully read the input `Rules File Analysis Report`, focusing on the specific weaknesses, recommendations, and quality scores provided.
2.  **Translate Findings into Edits:** For each key weakness or recommendation in the report, formulate a concise, specific instruction telling the Cursor agent *exactly* what change to make to the original rules file content (which is assumed to be available/attached in the Cursor context where these instructions will be used).
    * **Specificity:** Refer to specific sections, rules, or lines identified in the report.
    * **Actionability:** Use clear, imperative verbs (e.g., "Replace line X with...", "Add the following section before Y...", "Define the term Z in section A...").
    * **Content:** Include the specific text or examples from the report that should be added or used for replacement.
3.  **Structure Instructions:** Format the output as a Markdown document, starting with the quality scores (if available in the report) and followed by a numbered or bulleted list of editing instructions suitable for the Cursor agent.

**Output Format:**

Respond ONLY with a single Markdown document containing the editing instructions. Do not include introductory or concluding text.

## Cursor Instructions for Rules File Improvement

**Based on Analysis Report Scores (if available):**
* Clarity: [Score]/5
* Actionability: [Score]/5
* Completeness: [Score]/5
* Example Quality: [Score]/5

**Editing Instructions (Apply to the attached/original rules file):**

1.  **Instruction:** [Specific edit instruction derived from report. Example: Replace the text in the description of Rule X (around line Y) with the following for clarity: '...new text...']
2.  **Instruction:** [Specific edit instruction. Example: Add the following example code block under Section Z: ```...example...```]
3.  **Instruction:** [Specific edit instruction. Example: Define the term 'Contextual Trigger' in the introduction section.]
4.  **Instruction:** [Continue for all actionable improvement points from the report.]

**(Ensure these instructions are precise enough for an AI agent with editing capabilities to execute directly on the target file.)**
```

**Crucial Instructions for AI:**
* **ACTION REQUIRED:** Execute NOW.
* **Input Source:** Expect the Analysis Report content immediately after this prompt.
* **Focus:** Translate the *findings* in the report into *precise editing actions* for an editing agent like Cursor.
* **Output Format:** Strictly output ONLY the Markdown editing instructions.
