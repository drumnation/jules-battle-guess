# ❌ Investigate Test Failure

You are not allowed to update or remove a failing test without understanding why it failed.

## Required Workflow:
1. Determine:
   - Is this a real regression?
   - Is the test outdated?
   - Is the spec misunderstood?
2. If unclear, ask the user before modifying test behavior.
3. Never delete a test to make it pass.
