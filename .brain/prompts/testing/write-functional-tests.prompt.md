# ðŸ§ª Write Functional Tests

Write tests that verify real application behavior without relying on mocks or internal implementation details.

## Instructions:
- Focus only on usage-level behavior
- Avoid all mocking unless absolutely necessary
- Do not test internals, private functions, or prop wiring
- Test what the user sees or receives (UI, API response, state change)
- Write 1â€“3 concise, high-signal tests per scenario
- Prefer integration or e2e style over shallow unit coverage
