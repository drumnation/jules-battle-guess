# ðŸ§  Design Test Strategy for Feature

Design a minimal but complete test plan that:
- Validates functional behavior
- Covers the feature's core use cases
- Requires no unnecessary mocking
- Enables fast detection of regressions

Organize the test plan by test type:
- Functional (preferred)
- Integration
- Unit (only if pure logic)
