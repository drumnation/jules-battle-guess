# âœ… Validate with Tests After Task

After finishing a task or plan step, run tests to ensure correctness.

## Instructions:
- Run functional/integration/e2e tests for the affected area
- Do not skip if you see lint/typecheck success
- Tests = source of truth
- If tests fail: halt and investigate
- If no tests exist: suggest the user add one
